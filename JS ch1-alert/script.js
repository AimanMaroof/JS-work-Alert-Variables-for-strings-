// QS.5 --> EXPLANATION...

// alert : This is a function in JS that creates a pop-up dialog box with a message. 
// (   ) : These parentheses are used to pass data. In this case, the data is the message we want to display.
// "Hey! Aiman Maroof here." : This is a string (text) that contains the message. It's wrapped in double quotes because it’s a piece of text that needs to be displayed.
// ; : The semicolon marks the end of the JS statement. It tells the browser that the statement is complete.
